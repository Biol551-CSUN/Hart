### FOLDERS
**1. NA (_Practice - test repository_)**
* **Data: NA**
* **Output: NA**
* **Scripts: NA**

**Committed: NA (_Learned - Week2a_)**  
**Summary:** This folder is not available because the HART repository was not made yet along with the class's repository. However, an introduction to making a repository was initialized (set to public and checked the 'Add READMNE file'). The code was copied to RStudio (New Project/Version Control/Git).

**2. Week_2**
* **Data: [weightdata.csv](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Data/weightdata.csv)** 
* **Output: NA**
* **Scripts: [Week2b.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Scripts/Week2b.R)**  

**Committed: 2022-02-03**  
**Summary:** This is my first **[script](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Scripts/Week2b.R)** that was pushed to my repository, and I learned **6 functions**. The **_Output folder_** did not show as the project was committed because there was nothing on that folder. In short, **no data means no folder**. The **[data](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Data/weightdata.csv)** used this week was copied from the **[class's repository](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Spring-2022)**. This data outlines the **wide data** and not the long data.
