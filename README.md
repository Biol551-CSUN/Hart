# Hart
**BIOL551:** Computer Modeling - _Spring 2022 CSUN_  
**Created by:** Joynaline Hart - _student_  
**Class's repository:** [Spring-2022](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Spring-2022)  
**Description:** In here, weekly projects will be committed into this repository with the **three subfolders (Data, Output, Scripts)** for easy accessibility and organization.  
> _**For my own notes**, I added summaries for each week. (Kaya-mukat)_  
> _**Practice folder:** This is where I redo the lab works. Comment sections contain my own dialect. Again, this is just for me._  
> 
> This is my first time learning Rstudio and using Github. If you have any ideas on how I can make every project easier or tidier, I am open to suggestions. Thank you. :)

# FOLDERS
**1. NA (_test repository_)**
* **Data: NA**
* **Output: NA**
* **Scripts: NA**

**Committed: NA (_Learned 2022-02-01_)**  
**Summary:** This folder is not available because the **[HART repository](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart)** was not made yet along with the **[class's repository](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Spring-2022)**. However, an introduction to making a repository was initialized (set to public and checked the 'Add READMNE file'). The code was copied to RStudio (New Project/Version Control/Git).

**2. Week_2**
* **Data: [weightdata.csv](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Data/weightdata.csv)** 
* **Output: NA**
* **Scripts: [Week2b.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Scripts/Week2b.R)**  

**Committed: 2022-02-03**  
**Summary:** This is my first **[script](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Scripts/Week2b.R)** that was pushed to my repository, and I learned **6 functions**. The **_Output folder_** did not show as the project was committed because there was nothing on that folder. In short, **no data means no folder**. The **[data](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Data/weightdata.csv)** used this week was copied from the **[class's repository](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Spring-2022)**. This data outlines the **wide data** and not the long data. 
> **Class's activity/tasks**

>> * **Tuesday:** I did my first [ggplot2](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_3/Scripts/Week_3a.R). This was not graded, but it was a good way to practice the PACP. _(Note to self: pull ka always sa folder kung asa nimo ganahan i-add. Sunod, adto kas Week3 folder nimo para ma push ang tanan. Question = will that also push this script?)_

**4. Week_4**
