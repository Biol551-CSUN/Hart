### FOLDERS
**1. Week_2**
* **Data:** [weightdata.csv](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Data/weightdata.csv) 
* **Output**
* **Scripts:** [Week2b.R](https://github.com/Biol551-CSUN/Hart/blob/main/Week_2/Scripts/Week2b.R)  

**Summary:** The data used this week was copied from the class's folder. This data outlines the **wide data** and not long. I made a new script and pushed that to my repository. Along that, I learned **6 functions**. Output folder did not show as the project was committed because there was nothing on that folder. In short, **no data means no folder**.  

**2. Week_3**
* **Data:** 
* **Output:** 
* **Scripts:**
